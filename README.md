# ðŸ§  Image Classification â€” Concept & Working

This model predicts the **top 5 most likely classes** for a given image using a deep learning model. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the concept, working, and the flow:

---

## 1. Concept

- **Image Classification:** The task of assigning a label (class) to an image based on its content.
- **Top-5 Predictions:** Instead of predicting only the single most probable class, the model outputs the **5 most probable classes** with their confidence scores.  
- **Deep Learning Model:** Uses a neural network (pre-trained or custom-trained) to analyze images and learn patterns from pixel data.

## 2. Working Flow

1. **Load the Model:**  
   - A pre-trained model (like ResNet, VGG, or MobileNet) or a custom-trained model is loaded into memory.
   - The model has been trained to recognize specific classes.

2. **Image Preprocessing:**  
   - Resize the image to match the input size expected by the model (e.g., 224x224).  
   - Normalize pixel values (usually scale between 0â€“1).  
   - Expand dimensions to create a batch of size 1 (needed for prediction).

3. **Prediction:**  
   - The preprocessed image is fed into the model.  
   - The model outputs probabilities for all possible classes.

4. **Top 5 Selection:**  
   - Sort the probabilities in descending order.  
   - Select the top 5 highest probability classes.  
   - Map indices to human-readable labels.

5. **Display Results:**  
   - Print the top 5 classes with their confidence scores.  
   - Optionally, display the image along with predictions.

## 3. Prerequisites & Dependencies

The project likely relies on the following libraries:

- **Python 3.6+:** The primary programming language.  
- **TensorFlow or PyTorch:** Deep learning framework for building and running the model.  
- **Keras (if using TensorFlow):** High-level API for building and training neural networks.  
- **NumPy:** Library for numerical computation.  
- **PIL (Pillow):** Library for image processing.  
- **Matplotlib:** Library for plotting and visualization.

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pillow matplotlib
